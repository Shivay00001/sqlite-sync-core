# Why Purchase a Commercial License?

For businesses and enterprises, **SQLite Sync Core** offers a compelling Return on Investment (ROI) compared to building in-house or relying on expensive cloud platforms.

## 1. The "Build vs. Buy" Advantage

Building a robust, offline-first synchronization engine is deceptively difficult. It involves complex distributed systems problems:

- Vector clocks & causality
- Conflict detection & resolution
- Deterministic replay guarantees
- Delta compression & serialization

**Cost Analysis:**

- **In-house Build:** Requires senior engineers. 3-6 months development + ongoing maintenance.
  - *Estimated Cost:* **$50,000 - $150,000+**
- **Commercial License:** Instant access to production-grade, tested code.
  - *Cost:* Fraction of development cost.

## 2. Zero Infrastructure Costs (CapEx & OpEx Savings)

Most sync alternatives (Firebase, AWS AppSync, Couchbase) charge on data transfer, storage, or active users.

- **SQLite Sync Core:** Peer-to-Peer & Offline-First.
- **Cloud Savings:** You pay **$0** in monthly cloud sync fees. You own the data pipeline.

## 3. Data Sovereignty & Regulations

For industries like **Healthcare (HIPAA)**, **Finance**, **Defense**, or **Legal**, sending data to a third-party cloud is often a risk or a violation.

- **Your Advantage:** Data never leaves your controlled environment. Sync happens over local networks (WiFi/LAN) or your own private channels.

## 4. Business Continuity (Offline Capabilities)

Apps that break without internet lose revenue.

- **Field Service:** Oil rigs, mines, rural delivery.
- **Retail:** POS systems function even when ISP fails.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Systems communicate without central servers.

## 5. No Vendor Lock-in

We use standard **SQLite**.

- If you stop using our sync engine, your data is just... data.
- No proprietary cloud databases or formats to export from.

## 6. Enterprise Support

Commercial licenses come with:

- Priority bug fixes
- Architectural consulting
- Integration support
- Legal indemnification (optional based on tier)
